# About this Repo:

This repo containes Go code from various tutorials that I watched/read to learn Go. None of the the examples are mine and I just made few small changes plus adding comments whenever I felt there is a need. 

If you are compeletly new to Go, I would recommend you to start with the freeCodeCamp folder and here is the link to [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
